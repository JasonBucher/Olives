# Prototype Template — Intent

This template exists to make it easy to explore small economic/idle prototypes without getting lost in plumbing.

It assumes a philosophy:
- Production takes time
- Conversion often involves loss
- External systems can act independently
- Capital/meta resources are elevated and separate from day-to-day production

It does NOT assume:
- Infinite growth
- Perfect efficiency
- Instant conversion
- Full institution simulation

## UI Contracts (3 columns)

The default layout is three columns, each a conceptual contract:

- **Left: Capital (Meta)**
  - Persistent, slow-moving resources (e.g., Florins, Influence)
  - Upgrades and investments live here

- **Middle: Estate (Production Engine)**
  - Systems that produce and convert goods over time
  - Capacity, strain, inefficiency, breakdown

- **Right: Institutions (External)**
  - Market / Church / Bank / etc.
  - Systems you interact with but don’t own

## Anti-bloat rule

If you find yourself adding:
- detailed worker AI
- complex upgrade trees
- full institution simulation

Stop and create a new prototype instead of expanding the template.
