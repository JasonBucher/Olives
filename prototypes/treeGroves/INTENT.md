# treesMarket — INTENT

This prototype explores **production, loss, and delayed conversion**.

It is not about speed, infinite growth, or instant optimization.
It is about building a fragile but profitable system and learning where value is lost.

## Core Idea

Olives do not appear in your inventory.

They grow on trees.
They must be harvested.
They must be processed.
They must be transported.
They may be lost at every step.

Money only matters once you have something worth protecting.

---

## What This Prototype Is About

### 1. Trees Accrue Value Slowly
- Olive trees produce olives passively over time.
- Trees have a **maximum capacity**.
- When trees are full, growth stops and potential is wasted.

The player is pressured to act, not because they want to go faster, but because waiting has a cost.

The player can expand their groves to hold more tree and therefore hold more capacity.

Groves are under threat at all times from events that can destroy them, their fruit or impact their growth

---

### 2. Harvesting Is Separate and Imperfect
- Olives on trees are not usable.
- Harvesting moves olives from trees into inventory.
- Harvesting:
  - takes time
  - can be done manually
  - can be automated with workers
  - is imperfect (inefficiency, delay, loss)

This creates friction between *what exists* and *what you control*.

---

### 3. Presses Convert — and Fail
- Olive presses turn harvested olives into oil.
- Pressing takes time.
- Presses degrade, strain, or break.
- Repairs cost resources or money.

Failure is expected, not exceptional.

---

### 4. Markets Are Risky, Not Instant
- Goods are sent to market, not instantly sold.
- Markets have limited capacity.
- Outcomes include:
  - partial sales
  - rot / spoilage
  - loss in transit
  - (later) theft or disruption

Selling is a gamble, not a button.

---

### 5. Information Matters
The player should not just see numbers go up or down.

A log reports events such as:
- “5 olives sold, 20 olives rotted”
- “Olive press broke”
- “Shipment partially lost”
- “Transport robbed”

Loss should be *felt* and *understood*, not hidden.

---

## Upgrade Philosophy

Upgrades primarily:
- reduce loss
- reduce friction
- increase reliability

Examples:
- Increase tree capacity
- Reduce animal loss (scarecrows, guards)
- Improve harvest efficiency
- Improve press durability
- Increase market capacity
- Recover a percentage of unsold goods
- Protect shipments

Upgrades are not just “more per second.”
They are about **wasting less**.

---

## What This Prototype Is NOT

- Not a traditional farm sim
- Not a clicker focused on raw throughput
- Not an instant-buy / instant-sell economy
- Not about Florins as the main loop (yet)

Money is a consequence, not the goal.

---

## Long-Term Direction (Out of Scope for Now)

This prototype exists to establish:
- a credible production economy
- meaningful profit
- accumulated capital

Only after that does it make sense to explore:
- institutions
- banking
- storage
- political or religious influence
- becoming someone who controls systems rather than runs a business

That is a later era.

## Success Criteria

This prototype is successful if:
- loss feels inevitable but reducible
- the player is forced to make tradeoffs
- waiting can be harmful
- money feels earned, not trivial
- the system feels interconnected and fragile

If it answers these questions, it has done its job.
