# treeGroves — Intent

treeGroves is an early-era economic simulation focused on agricultural production,
logistics, loss, and the slow accumulation of capital and influence.

This prototype is not about speed or infinite growth.
It is about building a fragile but profitable system and learning where value is lost.

Money is not the goal.
Money is the consequence of systems that are working — imperfectly.

## Core Concept

Olives do not appear in your inventory.

They grow on trees.
They must be harvested.
They must be processed.
They must be transported.
They may be lost at every step.

Waiting can be harmful.
Overproducing can be wasteful.
Efficiency is earned, not assumed.

---

## Column Model

The game is structured into three conceptual columns.
These columns are design contracts, not merely UI layout.

Each column represents a different relationship to time, risk, and control.

---

### Left Column — Growth / Capital (Meta)

This column represents accumulated power and abstraction.

Examples:
- Florins
- Influence
- Indulgences
- Patronage

These resources are:
- Persistent
- Slow-moving
- Compounding
- Used to unlock upgrades, institutions, and new eras

Upgrades, investments, and long-term decisions live here.

Capital should feel elevated and separate from daily production.
It binds systems together without being directly produced by them.

---

### Middle Column — Estate / Fattoria (Production Engine)

This column represents the physical reality of the operation.

Layers include:
- **Farm**
  - Grove
  - Olive Trees
  - (later) Vineyard, varietals
- **Production**
  - Olive Press
  - Other conversion machinery
- **Workers**
  - Harvesters
  - Processors
- **House** (future)
  - Living space
  - Lineage
  - Reputation

This is where:
- Time-based systems operate
- Capacity, strain, inefficiency, and breakdown exist
- Moment-to-moment play happens

This column is tangible, fragile, and exposed to events.

---

### Right Column — External Institutions

This column represents systems outside the player’s direct control.

Examples:
- Market
- Church
- Bank

These systems:
- Act on items sent to them
- Introduce randomness, delay, and risk
- Convert production into capital, legitimacy, or debt

Markets buy, steal, rot, and fluctuate.
Banks lend, entangle, and collapse.
Churches forgive, legitimize, and demand.

You interact with these systems, but you do not own them.

---

## Shipping vs Market (Important Distinction)

Shipping is a **process**.
Market is a **place**.

- Shipping moves goods from the estate to the outside world.
  - It takes time.
  - It has outcomes.
  - Goods may be lost, stolen, or delayed.

- Market is where goods reside once they arrive.
  - Buyers appear over time.
  - Theft, rot, and events occur.
  - Conversion to Florins happens here, not instantly.

This separation is critical to pacing, tension, and meaning.

---

## Events Philosophy

Events should:
- Modify variables, not replace systems
- Be readable in the log
- Stack and interact
- Create stories through loss and recovery

Examples:
- Storm reduces tree growth temporarily
- Bandits increase shipping theft
- Bountiful season increases tree capacity
- Calm roads improve shipping speed

---

## Design Principles

- Shipping is a process, not a button
- Markets are places, not conversions
- Capital is meta and elevated
- Loss should be visible, logged, and understandable
- Systems should interlock, not stack
- Realism is not the goal; coherence is

---

## Non-Goals (For This Prototype)

- No detailed land plots
- No micromanaged workers
- No full institutional simulation yet
- No late-era politics or banking mechanics

Those belong to later eras.

---

## Success Criteria

This prototype is successful if:
- Loss feels inevitable but reducible
- Waiting can be a mistake
- Tradeoffs are constant
- Money feels earned, not trivial
- Systems feel interconnected and fragile
